## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Initially I was getting confused on how to plan my layout keeping both mobile and desktop view, so I went ahead with doing mobile first and then desktop became easy.

- One of the CSS properties wasn't getting applied and I was pretty much sure of my method. Then after going through MDN docs and stackoverflow, I learnt about specificity.

```
  .customer-testimonials .user2{
    margin-top: 3rem;
  }
  ```

### Continued development

I took this challenge to sharpen my CSS skills. I have been working with HTML & CSS and ReactJS here and there but I wanted to **solidify** my concepts so that I would be in a better place to comprehend web development more.

It's long-due planning that has been ongoing, and finally, I could complete my first step toward advancing in CSS.
I want to focus more on both basic and advanced CSS fundamentals along with HTML and vanillaJS. Once I am comfortable in these areas, I would jump into a new framework.
My CTA are-

- Flexbox
- Grid
- Getting more comfortable with CSS combinators and pseudo-elements



### Useful resources

- [Using CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This helped me in understanding CSS custom properties.
